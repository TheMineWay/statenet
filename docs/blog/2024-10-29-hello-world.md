Weâ€™re excited to announce the first alpha release of [StateNet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TheMineWay.StateNet)!

<!-- truncate -->

ðŸŽ‰ Version **1.0.0-alpha.1** is now live, marking the beginning of an extensible state machine library designed to simplify complex workflows in .NET applications. This alpha version introduces the foundational structure for creating, managing, and testing finite state machines, providing features like event-driven transitions and customizable actions for each state.

As we progress, we look forward to adding more features, refining the API, and getting feedback from the community. Try out StateNet **1.0.0-alpha.1**, and let us know your thoughts. Weâ€™re just getting started!
